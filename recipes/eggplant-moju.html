            Sri Lankan eggplant Moju aka Batu Moju is a delicious sweet and
            savory eggplant dish that you should definitely make for your
            next rice and curry festive menu. This dried version of classic
            eggplant Moju is packed with flavor. Really good to make ahead of
            time and it can last a really long time without going bad.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love how every piece of eggplant is a flavor bomb. But what I
            love the most about this moju recipe is I can make a big batch at
            once and it can last a really long time without going bad. So
            whenever I’m going to have guests over, I can make this dish a
            week or two ago and put it in the fridge. If you’re a busy
            person, you can make this moju in your weekend and enjoy
            throughout the week.

            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Fry eggplants and pearl onions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut about 500g/ 1lb eggplants into thin half-circles (about
                2mm thick).
            </li>
            <li>Mix with a bit of turmeric powder as you cut them.</li>
            <li>
                Heat enough oil for deep frying and fry them in small batches
                until they are golden and crispy. (please read the
                description for more info and tips). Lay them in one layer on
                a paper towel to remove excess oil. (Fried eggplants were
                weighed about 150g)
            </li>
            <li>
                Also oil-blanch your shallots. Means put the shallots into
                your heated oil and leave it for about 10 seconds and take
                them out immediately before they turn brown. The color of the
                Asian shallots/pearl onions would become a little pale.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making the Moju</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat about 1tbsp oil in a pan. Then add your onions, chilies,
                and curry leaves. Fry the onions until they are golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lower the heat. Then add a generous amount of Maldive fish
                flakes and chili flakes. Mix with the onions and fry for a
                few seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Move everything to a side of the pan and add ketchup, white
                vinegar sugar, and salt (adjust as per your taste).
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix ketchup, vinegar, sugar, salt and wait till the mixture
                heats up.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix everything in the pan lightly together. Don’t let the
                mixture dry out before you add eggplants.
            </li>
            <li>
                Immediately add fried eggplants, and shallots (you can also
                add oil-blanched green chilies).
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix with the mixture well together and cook for about a
                minute while stirring on low heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do a taste test and feel free to add sugar and salt if needed
                while the moju is still warm. The dish will taste better the
                next day.
