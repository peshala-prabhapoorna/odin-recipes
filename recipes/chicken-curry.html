        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Marinate chicken with all the marinating ingredients given in
                the list overnight or at least half an hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a mortar and pestle, grind cardamom and cloves. You can
                remove the shells.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then add ginger and garlic into the mortar and pestle and
                crush them to a coarse paste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a pan. (clay pots are ideal, if not use any heavy bottom
                pan) Add the ginger-garlic paste you made in the previous step
                . Also, add curry leaves and pandan leaves.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the mixture starts to turn brown add roasted curry
                powder and roasted chili powder. Mix and toast well in the
                oil for about 30 seconds. Do not let the spices burn.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the piece of goraka (Garcinia cambogia) onions and
                tomatoes. Mix well with the spices. Lower the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                cover, and cook until onions start to sweat and tomatoes
                become mushy. Make sure to mix in between to distribute even
                heating and avoid the bottom from burning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then add your chicken and mix really well. Cook for about a
                minute while continuously stirring.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a cup of water (you can substitute it with thin coconut
                milk for a creamier curry). Cover and simmer for 30mins on
                low heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                In 30 mins, adjust salt to your taste and also add about 1/
                2tsp of black pepper. Mix, cover back and simmer for another
                15mins.
